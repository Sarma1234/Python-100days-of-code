# Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days,
# leap years have 366, with an extra day in February.
# This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.
# on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder
# except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder
# unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder
# If english is not your first language or if the above logic is confusing, try using this flow chart .
# e.g. The year 2000:
# 2000 รท 4 = 500 (Leap)
#
# 2000 รท 100 = 20 (Not Leap)
#
# 2000 รท 400 = 5 (Leap!)
# So the year 2000 is a leap year.

year = int(input())

if (year % 4 == 0) and (year % 100 != 0):
    print("Leap year")

elif (year % 100 == 0) and (year % 400 == 0):
    print("Leap leap")


else:
    print("Not leap year")
